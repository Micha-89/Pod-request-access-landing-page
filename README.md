# [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) - Pod request access landing page

This is my solution for the following Frontend Mentor [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pod-request-access-landing-page-eyTmdkLSG). 

Frontend Mentor is a website that provides professional web designs in Figma. You then use this to build the website. 
It is an amazing way to practice using Figma and to implement complex designs, pushing your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to the next level.

This website uses a basic Regex email validation. 

This version is not mobile responsive. You can take a closer look [here](https://pod-request-access-git-main.micha-89.vercel.app/).
